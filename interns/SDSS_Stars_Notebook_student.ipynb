These surveys allow astronomers to do do large-scale statistical analysis on stars and galaxies, identify rare objects and help to choose targets for large observing facilities like the VLT or JWST.</p>\n",
    "<p>In this lab we are going to use data from both the Gaia satellite and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Gaia measured the positions of billions stars extremely accurately over the course of several years. These measurements were then used to calculate the parallax (relating to how far away a star is) and proper motion (the apparent motion across the sky). The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a series of ground-based surveys on relatively small telescopes in New Mexico and Chile. SDSS measured the spectra of four million stars, galaxies and exotic objects. Both Gaia and SDSS also measured the brighness of stars in different colours of light.</p>\n",

We then use this Gaia ID number to <b>JOIN</b> with the main Gaia data table <code>GaiaDR2.gaia_source</code>.

Detections with higher significances are generally much more reliable than low significance detections.</li>\n",

So if we want to look at stars of different metallicities we need to find stars of different ages.</p>\n",
    "<p>It's pretty hard to measure the age of a star, but there is a shortcut we can take. The Milky Way is made up of several different populations of stars. In the area around the Sun, the two largest populations are disk stars and halo stars. Disk stars are younger than 10 billion years old and, like the Sun, they orbit around the galaxy in a flat disk. In the area around the Sun the disk stars are all moving, more or less, in the same direction and speed as the Sun as they go around the Galaxy. Some will be faster, some slower, some will move in slightly different directions, but they mostly follow the same orbital flow around the Galaxy. Halo stars are a much older, and hence metal-poor, population of stars. They are all older than 10 billion years old and orbit the Galaxy in randomly aligned orbits. As halo stars don't move with the general orbit of disk stars, which near the Sun is about 200 kilometres per second, then they all appear to have very high velocities relative to the Sun and to an observer on Earth.</p>\n",
    "<p>Let's find out a bit about the velocities our stars are moving at by calculating the tangential velocity. This is the velocity they are moving at perpendicular to the line of sight we view them from. To do this we first calculate the total proper motion of each star by combining the proper motion in RA and Dec. Then we muliply the proper motion by a constant and by the distance.</p>"
