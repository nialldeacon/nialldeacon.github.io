       <h3>Hotels</h3>

       		<span><p>Heidelberg is a bit of a tourist trap so it has a lot of hotels. The venue is in Schlierbach which is a few miles east of the city on the south side of the river. There is one hotel in Schlierbach, the Park Atlantic but it's a bit inconvenient for visiting the rest of the city.</p> 
          <p>In town there are a number of hotels. Many of these are small hotels in the Altstadt which are great for visiting places in town but may be a bit pricey. There are more chain hotels in Bergheim and Weststadt like the Holiday Inn Express, Leonardo, NH and the Ibis next to the station. These are easier to get to by public transport but will require a bit of a walk to tourist spots in the Altstadt. The cheapest hotels are on or near Speyerstrasse close to where we live in Bahnstadt. These require a tram or bus ride to go into town but are easy to access via car from the Autobahn</p>

       		<span><p>There are a number of campsites to the east of Heidelberg (the right side of town for the venue). These are mostly around Neckargemund and are in the pretty Neckar valley. Niall's parents once stayed in Camping Haide</p></span>
