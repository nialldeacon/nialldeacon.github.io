       <h3>Hotels</h3>

       		<span><p>The nearest large airport to Heidelberg is Frankurt. This is a major hub for Lufthansa and is served by most major intercontinental airlines. From the UK you can fly from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Brimingham and Heathrow. The only budget airline that flies there from the UK currently (2019) is Ryanair from Stanstead. It's easy to get from Frankfurt Airport to Heidelberg, there's a high-speed train (ICE) to Mannheim where you change to a local train to Heidelberg</p>
                <p>There are two Ryanair hubs nearby, Karlsruhe-Baden and Frankfurt Hahn. Karlsruhe-Baden is a small former Canadian Airforce base (this explains why it has an ice rink with a curling team as you drive in). There are regular flights to Stanstead and the last few summers have had a flight from Ediburgh twice a week.</p>
          <p>In town there are a number of hotels. Many of these are small hotels in the Altstadt which are great for visiting places in town but may be a bit pricey. There are more chain hotels in Bergheim and Weststadt like the Holiday Inn Express, Leonardo, NH and the Ibis next to the station. These are easier to get to by public transport but will require a bit of a walk to tourist spots in the Altstadt. The cheapest hotels are on or near Speyerstrasse close to where we live in Bahnstadt. These require a tram or bus ride to go into town but are easy to access via car from the Autobahn</p>

       		<span><p>There are a number of campsites to the east of Heidelberg (the right side of town for the venue). These are mostly around Neckargemund and are in the pretty Neckar valley. Niall's parents once stayed in Camping Haide</p></span>
