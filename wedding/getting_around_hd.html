		 <h3>By Public Transport</h3>

		<span><p>Heidelberg has pretty good public transport. There are major tram lines running through all parts of the city except the old city (Altstadt). All but the number 24 go through Bismarkplatz which is the main transport hub. There are a few trams that stop at the main station stop (Hauptbahnhof). Note that some trams go to Hauptbahnhof Süd which is on the other side of the station and is 10 minutes walk from the other tram stops. The number 5 goes from the station to Bismarckplatz. These go out to surrounding towns such as Eppelheim and Rohrbach. Some trams stop running around midnight but some (like the 5) run hourly even late at night.</p>
			<p>There are also a decent number of buses. These mostly go through Bismarckplatz. There are a couple of buses that go into the old city (Altstadt), both the 31 and 32 stop at Uniplatz and go to Bismarkplatz with the 32 carrying on to the main station.</p>
			<p>To get to the castle you're best to get the mountain railway (Bergbahn) from Kornmarkt. You can buy a combined return Bergbahn to the castle + castle entry ticket from the station at Kornmarkt. If you want to go further up the hill you can buy a ticket to go to Molkenkur where you can switch to the rickety old wooden Bergbahn to the top of Konigstuhl. Note the Bergbahn can be quite crowded.</p>
			<p>The wedding venue is up the hill in Schlierbach. You can get the 33 or 35 bus to Jägerhaus and walk up the hill (it's a little steep). On the way back there's a night bus once an hour from Jägerhaus (the M4) or you can get a taxi. Let us know if you aren't planning to come by car and would struggle to get to the venue by public transport, we will try to arrange lifts with other guests who live locally.</p>
			<p>Single public transport tickets can be bought from ticket machines at many (but not all) stops and from bus (but not tram) drivers. You can also buy day tickets or three-day tickets from machines or from the ticket centre near the main station. You can also buy tickets through the VRN app. If you get a paper ticket make sure you stamp your ticket at a machine on the tram or bus. Heidelberg (including most surrounding towns but not Eppelheim or Neckargemund) is one zone for public transport. The venue is also in the Heidelberg zone. Check the <a href="https://www.rnv-online.de/english/">RNV website</a> for more info. <BFFP2 or surgical masks are required on all public transport in Heidelberg and at all bus and tram stops.</b></p>

		<span><p>Getting round Heidelberg by car isn't great. There are a couple of big parking garages. One under Darmstadterhof near Bismarkplatz, one below Karlsplatz below the castle and a few along Freidrich Ebert Anlage (one under Freidrich Ebert Platz). However on a Saturday these are often full. There are electronic signs on most approaches to town indicating how many spaces there are in each garage and directing you towards them.</p>
			<p>To get to the venue from Heidelberg you'll need to head along the southern side of the River Neckar then go up the hill once you get to Schlierbach. From the west side of town you can take the tunnels from Seegarten that byepass the old city for a quicker journey</p>
			<p>The address of the restaurant is Restaurant Wolfsbrunnen, Wolfsbrunnensteige 15, 69118 Heidelberg. Note that there is very little parking at the restaurant. The restaurant parking is about 30 metres before you come to the restaurant.</p>
