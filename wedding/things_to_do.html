       		<span><p>Heidelberg is a popular tourist destination. At the heart is the old city (Altstadt) where you can find the castle, the old bridge and many other attractions. Most of the area is pedestrain with the Hauptstrasse being one of the longest pedestrian streets in Europe. Once you get to the Altstadt most things are walkable. It's also where most of the restaurants and cafes are. Note most shops are closed in Germany on a Sunday. Cafes, restaurants and most museums are open as are some of the tourist shops in Altstadt.</p></span>

	<h3>The Main Attractions</h3>

		<span><p>The big thing in Heidelberg is the castle. You can either walk up there or get the Bergbahn railway up. The latter leaves from Kornmarkt and you can buy a combi castle + Bergbahn ticket at the station there. The castle has a 219,000 litre wine barrel and a pharmacy museum. The castle garden terrace also has what is probably the best view in Heidelberg. In the main part of town you can visit Marktplatz, the old bridge over the Neckar (Altebrücke) and some of the museums. The main museum in town is the Kurpfalz museum which has the history of Heidelberg from prehistoric Homo heidelbergensis to the Celts, Romans and later. Across the river you can walk up the Philospher's Way (Philosophenweg) or sit around next to the river at the Neckarweise. There are also river cruises (mostly from the southern bank of the river).</p></span>

		<h3>Hidden Gems</h3>

		<span><p>Possibly the coolest hidden thing in Heidelberg is the student prison. This is part of the university museum which you enter from Uniplatz. The main museum is about the history of the university. The student prison is where student were locked up, normally for fighting or duelling. The walls are covered with centuries of grafitti, some of it showing the typical Heidelberg silouhette motif. The Altstadt also has the German Packaging Museum which is a bit less dull than it sounds. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187286-d2707389-Reviews-Heidelberger_Zuckerladen-Heidelberg_Baden_Wurttemberg.html">Zuckerladen</a> is a weird sweet shop on Plöck (parallel to Haupstrasse) selling loads of random sweets. The owner also plays a game with you when you buy something. </p></span>

		<span><p>The area around Heidelberg has a lot of great places to visit. For those with families <a href="https://www.luisenpark.de/">Luisenpark</a> in Mannheim is great. It has loads of different animals and wonderful flora. To the east the Odenwald is a great place for hiking and has lots of pretty small towns. You can get a local train from Heidelberg main station Sudstadt/Weststadt or Altstadt stations towards Mosbach which stops at lots of pretty towns. Schwetzingen is about 20 mins away on the bus and has a castle with a <a href="https://www.schloss-schwetzingen.de/">stunning formal garden</a>. 
			To the south Hockenheim has the famous Hockenheimring racetrack. They do <a href="https://www.hockenheimring.de/activities/weitere-erlebnisse/insider-fuehrungen/">daily tours</a>. There's also the engineering museums at <a href="https://speyer.technik-museum.de/">Speyer</a> and <a href="https://sinsheim.technik-museum.de/">Sinsheim</a> (the latter has a Concorde and a Concordski).</p>
			<p>If you fancy watching some sport Sinsheim is the home of Bundesliga club Hoffenheim (season may not have started on 1st of August) and the small village of Sandhausen to the south has a Bundesliga 2 team (season probably will have started).</p>

		<h3>Food</h3>
		<div class="left-image"><img class="full-image" title="Spaghettieis" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qgxcE4z3GLrGIetVCO9epix6EpowshKL&export=download"/><div class="image-caption"> Spaghettieis, locals in Mannheim are very proud spaghettieis was invented there. The car was also invented there too but they seem to prefer spaghettieis. Credit: Pixabay and <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/SauLustig-889229/">SauLustig</a></div></div>
	
			<span><p>There are a few local specialities to try. Firstly there's flammkuchen, a wide, thin dough topped (usually) with bacon, onion and sour cream. This is common in eastern France and southwest Germany. There's also spaghettieis, a Mannheim invention where vanilla ice cream is pressed to look like spaghetti and covered with strawberry sauce instead of tomato sauce. Not really a culinary speciality but Heidelberg is the home of Capri Sun, the factory is just along the road in Eppelheim.</p></span>

		</ul>
		<p>Other cultures</p>
		<ul class="list1">
			<li>Sahara, great middle eastern place on Hauptstrasse. The vegetarian Sahara Mixplatte is briliant</li>
