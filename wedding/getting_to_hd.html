	      <h3>COVID-19 and travel</h3>
	      <p>Currently the UK is a "<a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/germany/entry-requirements">high risk area</a>" on the German warning system. This means travellers must show proof of vaccination to enter Germany or (for children under 12) proof of a recent negative test result. Germany is on the UK green list indicating you need a pre-departure test before entering the UK plus a PCR test on the second day after you arrive in the UK. </p>

       		<span><p>The nearest large airport to Heidelberg is Frankurt. This is a major hub for Lufthansa and is served by most major intercontinental airlines. From the UK you can fly from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Brimingham and Heathrow. The only budget airline that flies there from the UK currently (2019) is Ryanair from Stanstead. From Aberdeen you would need to change at either Schiphol, CDG or Heathrow. It's easy to get from Frankfurt Airport to Heidelberg, there's a high-speed train (ICE) to Mannheim where you change to a 15min local train to Heidelberg</p>
                <p>There are two Ryanair hubs nearby, Karlsruhe-Baden and Frankfurt Hahn. Karlsruhe-Baden is a small former Canadian Airforce base (this explains why it has an ice rink with a curling team as you drive in). There are regular flights to Stanstead and the last few summers have had a flight from Edinburgh twice a week. You could hire a car at Baden or get the bus to Rastatt and a train from there via Karlsruhe to Heidelberg. Hahn used to have regular flights to Edinburgh and Stanstead but those have stopped. Hahn isn't that close to Frankfurt so don't go to Heidelberg via Frankfurt. Instead rent a car or take a <a href="http://www.holger-tours.de/hahn-express-fahrplan/">long distance bus</a>.</p>
		<p>Stuttgart has flights to Edinburgh and Gatwick with Easyjet as well as Heathrow (BA & Eurowings) and Birmingham (Flybe). The airport is on the Stuttgart local train system so just get a train to Stuttgart main station and then an intercity to Heidelberg.</p>

       		<span><p>Heidelberg has a main station that has frequent intercity connections to most of south and western Germany. There are only a couple of the faster Intercity Express (ICE) trains a day. For most ICE connections you have to get a connecting local train to Mannheim (it takes 15mins or so). If you are staying in Schlierbach or Neckargemund there are trains to both from Heidelberg main station.</p></span>

		<span><p>Heidelberg is near a few major motorways. The A5 between Frankfurt and Karlsruhe (and eventually Basel) and the A6 which runs from Nuremburg to Saarbrucken (and then on the Paris as the French A4). There's a couple of routes from Stuttgart (the A8 then A5 or the A81 then A6). Lately the A5 from Karlsruhe has been a bit of a nightmare trafficwise.</p></span>
