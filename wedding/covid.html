	      <h3>General COVID-19 Regulations in Germany</h3>
        <p>There are two very basic things to know about Corona rules in Germany.<p>
        <ol>
          <li>Indoor public spaces plus all public transport and public transport stops/stations require <b>medical or FFP2 masks</b>. They are also required in restaurants when not seated at a table.</li>
          <li>Bars, restaurants, hotels, museums and hairdressers require that guests meet one of the 3Gs:
          <ul>
            <li>Geimpft - Fully Vaccinated with at least two weeks since the second dose and in possession of a vaccination certificate</li>
            <li>Genesen - Recovered from COVID-19 with a formal certificate stating this </li>
            <li>Getestet - Have certified negative test from a test centre within the last 24 hours. This can be a PCR or lateral flow test.</li>
          </ul>
          The main exception to the rules above is that nightclubs and discos require a certified PCR test not more than 24 hours old.
          </li>
          </ol>

		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>Many of you will be travelling back to the UK a few days after the wedding. For this situation it would probably be best to go to one of <a href="https://aspilos.de/testzentrum/">these test centres</a>. The test centre at Betriebshof is very close to the station. This centre (and a few others from this company) offer PCR test as well as lateral flow tests (called Schnelltests in German) along with certificates for travel. Please check what kind of test is required for your flight back. Some offer a walk-in service but we would suggest booking online first. Note the free lateral flow tests are only available to German residents. If your results don't come by email you can <a href="https://heidelberg.corona-ergebnis.de/">try this link</a></p>
		<p>If you are required to take a test a few days before travelling back (and aren't staying in Heidelberg for a long time), we would suggest getting tested on the morning of the wedding in-case there's a problem with your vaccination certificate.</p>
		<p>If you aren't travelling out of the country and just need a lateral flow test (Schnelltest) to attend the wedding or go to a restaurant, then you can also try one of <a href="https://testzentren-q-heidelberg.de">these test centres</a>. Again, you should book ahead and the free tests are only for German residents.</p>
		<p>Remember, unless you are fully vaccinated or recovered, you need a certified test less than 24 hours old for most bars/restaurants etc.</p>
